On the basis of a commercially available PC-XT compatible computer, a powerful two-processor computer system 
operating in 'real time' was built. The host computer (PC) is relieved from time-critical data acquisition 
by an autonomous subsystem (Z80-ECB). A time asynchronous computer coupling of the two computers by means of 
hardware FIFOs allows fastest data transfer rates in the MHz range. 

A standardized interface I/O bus (IOB) allows the connection of various measurement modules to the experiment. 
measurement modules to the experiment. 

The data acquisition system was successfully used for the polarization spectroscopic measurement of the 
hyperfine structure (Hfs) and isotopic shift (IS) of zircon in a hollow cathode gas Hollow cathode gas discharge.

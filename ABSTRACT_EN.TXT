Description of the individual components:
=========================================

Host computer system :
----------------------

The IBM-PC compatible computer as host system is the core of the DAS.

Due to its high computing speed (8 MHz clocked CPU), large memory 
capacity (640 KB RAM / 120 ns) as well as increased accuracy 
(8087/8 MHz coprocessor), the host system with its mass storage
(10 MB hard disk, 1.2 MB and 360 KB floppy disks), it represents 
an ideal control and evaluation system.

The control of the experiment sequence can be realized by the program running 
in the subsystem and the corresponding parameter transfer via PC.

A temporally asynchronous computer coupling of host and subsystem,
realized by hardware FIFOs, guarantees a faultless function of the
function of the PC computer at DOS operating system level. The PC-I/O
board includes a 96 bit wide parallel I/O strip (4 x 8255 PPI) and two 
16 bit (8254, 10 MHz) timers, bidirectional line drivers and receivers.
line drivers and receivers to ensure an interference-free signal
transmission between host and subcomputer.

A pre-reduction of the data as well as a graphical evaluation can be 
performed 'on-line' on the PC computer if required. The spectra can 
be displayed in a high-resolution (720x348 pixels) graphic on the 
screen and, if required, printed on an HP 7475A plotter or EPSON FX-100 printer.

For further evaluations, which require more time-intensive algorithms,
the data can be transferred by means of diskette data carriers (5 1/4", 360 KB)
to an IBM-4381 or IBM-3081 mainframe in the local computer center RHRZ 
(Rheinisches Hochschul-Rechenzentrum).


Subcomputer System :
--------------------

The Z80-ECB subcomputer, from Janich & Klass, controls the experiment in real time, 
while the IBM-PC with its comfortable operating system is responsible for further 
processing and storage of the measurement data.

In order to cope with the problem of real-time capability in the data acquisition
the Z80 subcomputer includes a ROM-resident FORTH operating system and a measurement
program stored in RAM, which can be adapted to the respective experimental conditions.

The two computers are coupled asynchronously via several hardware FIFOs (First-In-First-Out) 
which allows buffering and time decoupling of the two computers is guaranteed. At 
connection from the Z80 to the PC is a 16 bit wide and 128 byte deep wide and 128 byte deep 
data path, which is controlled by "two-wire-handshake". The maximum data rate of the FIFOs 
is approx. 1 MHz, which ensures a high measurement data transfer rate. The connection 
from the PC to the Z80 for initialization, parameter and measurement measurement program 
transfer is designed to be 8 bits wide and 128 bytes deep. 

The timing for the experiment is controlled via interrupt-gene Z80-CTCs 
(Counter-Timer-Circuit), which allows a fast processing of  fast occurring 
measurement signals is made possible.

If necessary, the measurement data can be stored temporarily in a RAM buffer, if the 
PC is busy with "user I/O". 


Interfacesystem :
-----------------

The interface bus system represents the actual interface to the physical experiment. 
Due to its universal bus structure and the modularity of the measurement plug-in 
units, one is not specific "measurement problem". By specific use of the modules 
and the appropriate choice of measurement programs, the setup can be quickly changed, 
for example, from an optical to an RF experiment.

A later expandability of the measuring system was taken into account by making 
the interface bus as universal as possible:

  * 16 data-OUT lines : MES => Experiment
  * 16 data-IN lines : Experiment => MES
  * 8 address lines : selection of 256 different measuring modules. 
  * 8 Control lines : Control of the different measuring modules. 

The individual modules consist of counters (TTL or ECL technology,
32 bit, max. 150 MHz), VFC card (Voltage-to-Frequency Converter),
high-frequency decade driver (BCD, 10 bits in parallel), 8 single-bit
IN (Instrumentation Amplifier), 8 single-bit OUT cards.

An extension e.g. by A/D- or D/A-converter boards is possible at any time.

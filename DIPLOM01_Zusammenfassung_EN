Summary:

In this work, a measurement acquisition system (MAS) was developed for use in high frequency and laser spectroscopy.

A two-processor computer system based on an IBM PC-XT compatible personal computer in combination with an ECB-Z80 system was built, 
the hardware necessary for computer interfacing was developed and a powerful terminal program (TERMINAL) for computer communication was implemented.

The overall system was tested with a test measurement of a ZrI spectrum with the method of polarization spectroscopy and checked for its performance. 

For the interpretation of the measured Hfs spectra, a simulation program (SPEKTRUM) was written to facilitate the assignment of the Hfs components to the 
lines of the recorded spectrum.

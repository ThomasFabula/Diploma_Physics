1. Introduction:

The objective of this work was to develop a convenient and powerful measurement acquisition system (MAS) based 
on an IBM PC-XT compatible computer, which can be used in high frequency as well as optical laser spectroscopy.

The advantages over the already used Z80-MAS /1, 2/ are mainly the real-time capability and universality of the 
system due to the two-processor computer system.

In order to ensure extensive utilization of the already existing Z80 hardware and software knowledge, a Z80 system 
was integrated as a subcomputer, which is to relieve the PC main computer in the measuring operation. The design 
of this subcomputer is essentially the same as that of the existing Z80 data acquisition system.

The new data acquisition system should also be characterized by a high degree of flexibility on both the hardware 
and software sides. This means that an appropriate selection of measurement plug-in modules and corresponding 
programs should enable the fastest possible conversion in laboratory operation.

For this purpose, a universal interface to the physical experiment was developed in the form of an input/output 
bus (IOB), which connects an interface unit with different measurement plug-in modules and a PC computer. 
This IOB interface bus is largely compatible with the bus system of the Z80-DAS system extension /3/.

The user operates the measuring program on the PC side, while the experiment control is taken over in real time 
by the Z80 subcomputer. This relieves the PC host computer and can thus be used for the pre-evaluation (reduction) 
of the data. Due to the fast hardware coupling of the both computers by means of FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and 
serial interface, respectively, the user can also follow the experiment 'on-line' (in real time) on the PC computer.

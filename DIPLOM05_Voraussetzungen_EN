2 Prerequisites for the work:

2.1 Previous data acquisition systems

The data acquisition systems (DAS) used so far were characterized on the one hand by their relatively low computing power, 
on the other hand by a limited expandability with respect to their interface and hardware structure.


PDP-8:

In the case of the PDP-8 from Digital Research Corporation (1968), one was dealing with a computer system that had become 
obsolete over time, and for which a hardware extension was always connected with a substantial expenditure at self-development. 
The PDP-8 computer hardware /4/ represented a closed complex. The connected interface unit was characterized by poor expandability, 
since it was not modular and bus-oriented. On the software side, due to the Teletype terminal and a punch tape reader/puncher 
system as external mass storage, there were also no development tools available. Editing and creating programs proved 
to be very cumbersome and error-prone with punched tape as the storage medium. 


Z80:

The introduction of a standardized ECB multi-board computer based on the Z80 microprocessor /5/ represented a significant improvement 
in terms of hardware modularization based on the Z80 microprocessor /5/. As an industrial standard, the ECB system guaranteed a large
number of hardware components for later extensions. The possibility of connecting external mass storage devices (1 MB drives, 8") 
and the use of the operating system CP/M 3.0, with the available available languages and programs, created a good software development
environment. Especially in computing power, the Z80 system surpassed the PDP-8 by a considerable margin: while previously only 
256 measuring points per scan could be recorded in the optical measurements /6/, the number increased to over 30000 with the 
new system. In addition, calibration mark signals could be recorded simultaneously via a second counter channel. The subsequent 
evaluation of the of the measurements was characterized by a high degree of user convenience, since it was automated by means 
of data carriers. This reduced the number of manually induced error sources could be reduced considerably.

However, some limitations in programming and application in the laboratory arose with the Z80 system due to its now obsolete 
architecture (8-bit CPU), its relatively low duty cycle (1 μs min. instruction cycle at 4 MHz), and the low memory 
addressability (64 kB) of the CPU. Although the memory capacity in the computer could be increased by "bankswitching" 
(switching to other 64 kB areas), it posed considerable problems in the measurement process. The programmer was forced 
to bypass the operating system CP/M 3.0 in order to realize interrupt driven process controls on assembler level to realize
interrupt driven process controls. The existing experiment interface could also only be extended with considerable effort, 
since it had no defined bus structure. A detailed description of the system can be found in the works of 
W. Kress /1/ and U. Urmoneit /2/.

2.2 Requirements for the new data acquisition system

The task of the thesis was to build up a complete data acquisition system on the basis of a PC-compatible computer for 
high-frequency and optical laser spectroscopy and to test it in laboratory operation. This included the creation of 
programs for the communication of the two computers, as well as a test two computers, as well as a test measurement 
program to control an experiment.

2.2.2 Software requirements

Since the function of the data acquisition system is to be determined essentially by the software, special 
requirements must be considered here:

- Modularity of the program parts and subroutines, in order to ensure successive testing:
		* FORTH (words)

2.3 Computer coupling

The problem of real-time processing quickly led to the necessity of using two independent computer systems. 
The two systems used represent an 'industry standard' (IBM-PC and ECB). However, the solution of the communication 
problem of the two systems turned out to be more difficult. 
A comparison of the generally used computer couplings /7/ should clarify the decision for the concept used here.
In the following the most important principle possibilities of the coupling of two computers are presented and 
compared with one another. In chapter 3 the technical details of the corresponding interfaces will be discussed further.

Serial computer coupling:

The serial computer coupling (RS-232 standard) is the most common way to connect computers with each other or 
computers with peripheral devices. Communication takes place via one line connection per data direction.

Advantages:  
	* Long transmission distances possible
	* Only one line connection necessary

Disadvantages:
	* Slowest of all data communications, since serial.
	* Handshake (hardware and/or software) required,
	  so that both computers are blocked during communication for
	  real-time measurement processes are blocked
	* Computers are not independent of each other


Fig. 1: Serial computer coupling

Parallel Computer Coupling:

Parallel computer coupling is a simple way to connect two systems together. The parallel I/O module (PIO), which 
is directly connected to the computer bus, communicates with the other system by means of the "handshake" lines. 
The READY signal announces the readiness to receive data, the STROBE signal indicates the intention to transfer 
the data. This procedure makes it particularly clear that both computers depend on each other and are dependent 
on each other and must be synchronized for communication.

Advantages:  
	* Fast data transfer, because parallel (8-bit).
	* Simple programming of the PIO device.

Disadvantages:
	* Time-consuming handshake (hardware and software)
	  required
	* Both computers are blocked during communication for
	  real-time measurement processes
 	* computers are not independent of each other


Fig. 2: Parallel computer coupling

Dual-Port RAM (DPR) Computer Coupling:

The computer coupling is done by a two-port memory directly connected to both data buses. Both computers can 
independently write and read directly to the memory cells of the RAM. These memory accesses can take place 
simultaneously, provided that the same memory location is not meant. A unique memory allocation must take place.
This is taken over by an arbitration logic /8/, which excludes that not simultaneously both computers on the 
same (physical) memory location write access.

Advantages:  
	* Data transfer rate very high (parallel)
	* Asynchronous communication possible

Disadvantages:
	* Direct bus connection to PC and Z80 difficult.	
	* Communication protocol must exclude simultaneous read access if necessary
	* More expensive than serial and parallel devices	


Fig. 3: Dual-port RAM computer coupling

FIFO computer coupling:

Here, the computer coupling is done via a buffer memory that preserves the temporal order of the incoming
data. In principle, the data buffer corresponds to a two-port memory, but the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) 
itself performs the arbitration.

An additional FIFO logic allows the contents of the data buffer to be read, cleared, among other things, 
to generate various conditional interrupts at any time. 
In dynamic operation, the FIFO allows buffering of the data and thus relieves the interface communication. 
Both computers can simultaneously access andc an write to and read from the data buffer at the same time. 
Computer interfacing with Zilog FIFO's has become a standard procedure (see e.g. /9/).

Advantages:  
	* Data transfer rate very high (parallel)
	* Asynchronous computer communication possible
	* Temporal decoupling of the computer systems during the
	  communication, so that both computers are independent of each other
	* Direct bus connection possible with the Z80 system
	* Time sequence of the data is preserved
	* Dynamic buffer operation
	
Disadvantages:
	* Programming of the device due to the multitude
	  of possibilities relatively complex
	* More expensive than serial and parallel blocks

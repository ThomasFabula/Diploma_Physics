Summary

Within the scope of this diploma thesis, a data acquisition system for use in high-frequency and laser spectroscopy was developed.

A two-processor computer system based on an IBM PC-XT compatible personal computer in connection with an ECB Z80 system was built, 
the hardware necessary for the computer coupling was developed and a powerful terminal programme (TERMINAL) for computer communication
was implemented.

The overall system was evaluated with a test measurement of a ZrI spectrum using the polarisation spectroscopy method and checked for 
its performance.

For the interpretation of the measured Hfs spectra, a simulation programme (SPEKTRUM) was developed to help assign the Hfs components
to the lines of the recorded spectrum.

4.5 Hfs simulation program (SPEKTRUM)

The SPEKTRUM program calculates and draws the hyperfine structure spectrum of a transition between two fine structure states. 
Input parameters are the name of the element, the angular momentum quantum numbers (I, Ju, Jo) and the Hfs constants 
(A and B factor) of the two fine structure states. 
The following parameters must be entered into the program by the user in this order (validity ranges of the parameters):

1.) Ao : A-factor for the upper state ( 0 - 9999 [MHz] )

2.) Au : A-factor for the lower state ( 0 - 9999 [MHz] )

3.) Bo : B-factor for the upper state ( 0 - 9999 [MHz] )

4.) Bu : B-factor for the lower state ( 0 - 9999 [MHz] )

5.) Jo : Envelope angular momentum of the upper state ( 0.5 - 99 [h] )

6.) Ju : Envelope angular momentum of the lower state ( 0.5 - 99 [h] )  	( 0.5 - 99 [h] )

7.) I : Nuclear spin of the atom ( 0.5 - 99 [h] )
				
8.) Untrgnd : Background ( 0 - 999 )

9.) FWHM : Half-width of the Hfs lines ( 1 - 999.99 [MHz] )

10.) Auflsng : Graphical resolution of the frequency axis ( 100 - 500 )
        
The name of the element and the spectroscopic designations of the lower and upper states can also be entered to identify a simulation. 

In order to avoid unnecessary sources of error and to increase the user-friendliness of the program, all the above parameters are 
stored in temporary files (SPEKTRUM.PAR, SPROFIL.PAR) and read in automatically at the start of the program. When the program is 
exited correctly, the parameters are saved for the next program run, so that the program can be restarted without time-consuming 
re-entry of the parameters. 

Program sequence:
The flow chart in Fig. 27 documents the simulation program sequence in detail. After the parameters have been read in and 
checked for correctness in a loop the user is asked for a file name for saving the data. The file name may consist of a maximum 
of eight The extension .DAT is generated automatically.

Based on the parameters entered, the program calculates the following values for the lower and upper states:

Quantum numbers F:
F = I + J, ... , │ I - J │

Casimir values K:
K = F ( F + 1 ) - I ( I + 1 ) - J ( J + 1 )

Energy levels W:
W = ½h {KA + ¼[ 3(K(K+1)-I(I+1)J(J+1))B / (I(2I-1)J(2J-1)]}

Line energies E:
E = │ W(Fo) - W(Fu) │ taking into account the  

selection rules:  	
    1. │ ⌂F │ = │ Fu - Fo │ = 0, 1
    2. fu = 0 -> fo = 0 prohibited.

The transitions that correspond to the selection rules are assigned the corresponding relative line intensities according 
to the following equation:

Intensities:
							| Jo Fo I |²
Intensity = (2Fo + 1) (2Fu + 1) | |
							| Fu Ju 1 |

and then the strongest component is normalized to 100 %.

To allow the user a quick check, all calculated values are displayed on the screen in addition to the number of components 
in the Hfs spectrum. This is followed by the graph structure and the query for the desired type of line shape. The user can 
choose between a Lorentz or Gaussian profile:

Lorentz profile:
L (E) ~ FWHM² / [ (E - E0)² + FWHM² / 4 ]

Gaussian profile:
G (E) ~ exp( - ½ [ (E - E0) / FWHM ]² )

To obtain a quick overview of the qualitative form of the spectrum, it is possible to display the spectrum in a simplified form
on the screen. With this program option, the transitions are only displayed as vertical lines, which has a very favorable 
effect This has a very favorable effect on the computing time and shortens it considerably. The user then has the option of
calculating and plotting the sum profile. An important aspect of the program was to display the spectrum as a summed line 
signal on the screen. In this display it is possible to the influence of the line width (FWHM) of the individual lines
on the total sum signal.

After the spectrum has been built up on the screen, the most important parameters are displayed in a window at the bottom of 
the screen. The information of the energies E(min) and E(max) as well as the line center of gravity allow the energy axis 
of the Hfs multiplet to be scaled (see Fig. 29).

Comparing the simulated spectrum with experimentally obtained spectra makes it easier for the experimenter to identify the 
measured lines. If the "simulated" spectrum corresponds to the measured Hfs spectrum in terms of the distribution of its 
components, the user can use the final parameters (*.PAR) and all calculated values in ASCII files (*.DAT), otherwise the 
program returns to parameter input.

If required, the screen content can be printed out on the connected printer (Prnt-Scr <0>) without having to interrupt 
the program. At the end of the program, a comment on the simulation run (max. 80 characters) can be entered for 
documentation purposes.

The simulation program was created in the Turbo Pascal programming language and is started at operating system level by 
a batch file (batch job). This batch file carries out the necessary printer and plotter initializations and briefly 
explains the program's options to the user (SPEKTRUM.TXT).

Additional program extensions have been added to facilitate the comparison of measured and simulated spectra. For various 
applications you now have the option of calculating the Hfs spectrum of two odd isotopes in addition to the additional 
specification of even isotopes that have no Hfs splitting (see isotopes (see Appendix D). A detailed description of this 
and other evaluation programs for Hfs measurements can be found in /38/.

In order to test the Hfs simulation program SPEKTRUM, it was compared with a measured spectrum (Fig. 28). For this purpose, 
a zircon spectrum from /39/ was used for this purpose. The transition from state a 3F4 to z 3F4 with a wavelength of 
612.744 nm was selected for this purpose. In addition to the four even-numbered isotopes (90Zr, 92Zr, 94Zr and 96Zr), 
six clearly resolved Hfs components of the odd-numbered zirconium isotope (91Zr) can be seen. The A and B factors and 
isotopic shifts were taken from the above work:

A and B factors:

	a 3F4 : Au = -77.90 MHz, Bu = -33.50 MHz
	z 3F4 : Ao = -274.90 MHz, Bo = -32.10 MHz

Isotopic shifts:

	90Zr : 0.0000 MHz ( 51.46 % )
	91Zr : -96.3600 MHz ( 11.23 % )
	92Zr : -230.6200 MHz ( 17.11 % )
	94Zr : -400.5500 MHz ( 17.40 % )
	96Zr : -523.8700 MHz ( 2.80 % )

The nuclear spin for the odd-numbered isotope is I=5/2.

For the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the lines 20 MHz were used. The SPEKTRUM program used these values to calculate 
the zirconium spectrum in Fig. 29. A comparison of the simulated spectrum with the measured spectrum shows good agreement 
in the distribution of the Hfs components. Clearly the Hfs components with lower intensities can be seen to be drowned out 
in the signal noise or covered by it in the area of the even isotopes.
